# Liver segmentation in computed tomography images
This project is an investigation of methods for automatic liver segmentation on CT images using the convolutional neural network UNet. The main goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation process, which is traditionally performed manually and requires significant time and professional resources. Within the framework of the project, the stages of data collection and preprocessing, model training and evaluation of its accuracy were carried out.

## Installation
Clone the repository
```r
git clone https://github.com/cuk66/ProjectSegmentation.git
```

## Data
All data for liver segmentation are taken from CHAOS (Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation). This dataset contains various medical images, which include both CT and MRI scans of the abdominal cavity, for the purpose of accurate segmentation and analysis of organs, including the liver.
